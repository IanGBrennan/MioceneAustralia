## Biogeographic Scripts
   + _'Empirical BGB Loop'_:  
   R code for looping BGB and BSM analysis across a set of empirical trees drawn from the posterior of a dating analysis. This uses the empirical (not simulated) data on species distributions. You can then summarize and plot the results to compare temporal trends in dispersal types. This includes estimating and plotting 95% confidence intervals.  
   
   + _'Simulated States BGB Loop'_:  
   R code for simulating data onto the phylogeny based on the empirical best-fit model (DEC+j). The loop runs BGB analysis and biogeographic stochastic maps (BSMs) across a set of empirical trees drawn from the posterior of a dating analysis. You can then summarize and plot the results to compare temporal trends in dispersal types. This includes estimating and plotting 95% confidence intervals.   
   
   + _'Plot Simulated vs. Empirical'_:  
   Plot temporal trends in dispersal types, comparing the results of the simulated and empirical BGB analyses. This will plot 95% confidence intervals for both.
