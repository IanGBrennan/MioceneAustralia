## Scripts for Analysis of Phenotypic Evolution
   + _New Models from Slater 2013_:  
   Slater 2013 code which includes the 'fitContinuous_paleo' function, with new models (SRC, TRC) from this study added.   
   
   + _geiger + OUwie Loop_:  
   R code for looping model fitting and comparison across a set of empirical trees drawn from the posterior of a dating analysis. You can then summarize and plot the results, to determine the best model-fit, and comparative AICcWt. Finally, you can pull out parameter estimates from the best fitting model, and plot these (including: rate/sigma.sq, theta/optimum trait value, alpha/constraint, and shift time).
