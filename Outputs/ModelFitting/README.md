## Comparative Model Fitting Results
   + _Trimmed Final..._:  
   Model fitting output for each radiation, using a trimmed down set of models (consistent with Fig.2), and recalculated AICcWt.  
   
   + _Best..._:  
   Model fitting output for each radiation, with results pared down to just the most preferred models for each given tree (delta AIC<2).
