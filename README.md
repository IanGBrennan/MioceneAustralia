# Miocene Australia
Associated files and scripts for manuscript on Late Miocene biome turnover, and phenotypic evolution of Australian vertebrates. This project focuses on shifts in biome dispersal history and body size evolution across five widely distributed Australian vertebrate radiations: marsupial mammals, meliphagoid birds, pygopodoid geckos, sphenomorphine skinks, and agamid lizards. 

This repository includes the following:  
## Data:
  ### Trees:  
   + Maximum clade credibility trees. (5x)  
   + 100 trees from dating analysis posteriors. (5x)     
  ### Phenotypic and Distributional Traits
   + Body size data (snout-vent length, body length, mass). (5x)
   + Distributional data, in binary format for BioGeoBEARS analysis. (5x)
   + Spreadsheet of raw body size and distributional data.
## Scripts:
  ### Biogeographic Analyses:
   + R code for BioGeoBEARS and Biogeographic Stochastic Mapping that iterates across a set of empirical trees, and summarizes and plots temporal trends in dispersal histories. 
   + R code for BioGeoBEARS and Biogeographic Stochastic Mapping that simulates data onto a specified tree under a specified historical biogeographic model, and summarizes and plots temporal trends in dispersal histories. 
  ### Modelling Phenotypic Evolution:
