# Miocene Australia
Associated files and scripts for manuscript on Late Miocene biome turnover, and phenotypic evolution of Australian vertebrates. This project focuses on shifts in biome dispersal history and body size evolution across five widely distributed Australian vertebrate radiations: marsupial mammals, meliphagoid birds, pygopodoid geckos, sphenomorphine skinks, and agamid lizards.
