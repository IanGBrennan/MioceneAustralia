### Figures in Main Text
    + Figure 1. Two-part figures showing congruence of phentoypic shift timing and proportional allopatry. 1A displays the crown divergence of each group, as well as the temporal trend of global climate. It also draws attention to the Late Miocene clustering of shifts inferred from modelling body size evolution. 1B displays temporal trend of global climate change through the Mid Miocene to present, as well as the predicted and estimated trends in allopatric dispersal events summed across all 5 radiations.
