### Figures in Main Text
   + _Figure 1._  
   Shifts in evolutionary mode (BM to OU) of body size evolution are temporally clustered in the Late Miocene, and congruent with a shift in dispersal histories. (A) Dotted lines indicate the crown divergence of each focal radiation, and colors match the distribution of inferred shift timing. Shifts between rates or modes (or both) of trait evolution are tightly constrained to the Late Miocene (11–5 Million years ago). Colored line shows global trend in temperature through the Cenozoic, data from Cramer, Miller, Barrett and Wright (4). (B) Inferred trends in the dispersal history of Australian radiations from the Early Miocene to present. The observed trend in proportion of allopatric dispersal events (in green), exceeds the expected simulated proportion (purple), in the Late Miocene, coinciding with constraints on body size evolution of select Australian vertebrate clades. Note, scales of temperature and time differ between (A) and (B). MMCO, Mid Miocene Climatic Optimum.  
   
   + _Figure 2._  
   Comparative fit of models to body size evolution data of Australian vertebrate clades finds preference for novel mode-variable models (SRC, TRC). Models are categorized below the plot. Dotted lines distinguish support for time-shifting models (gray) which incorporate a transition in rate or mode (or both) in the Late Miocene, and two novel time-shifting models (black) which specifically transition from Brownian Motion to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in the Late Miocene. The y-axis indicates the relative support for each model as Akaike weights (averaged across 100 posterior trees), and shows that time-shifting models with Miocene constraints, particularly those shifting from BM to OU are highly preferred. 
   
### Tables and Figures in Supporting Information
   + _Table S1._  
   Fossil and secondary calibrations used for dating estimates of Australian vertebrate radiations.  
   
   + _Figure S1._  
   Temporal trends in the proportion of allopatric dispersal events shift in the Late Miocene across all Australian vertebrate radiations studied. Combining results of all five radiations (>800 taxa) provides signal of increasing allopatry in the Late Miocene (10–5 Mya), above what was expected. 
   
   + _Figure S2._  
   Comparative fit of models to body size evolution data of Australian vertebrate clades finds preference for novel mode-variable models (SRC, TRC). Models are categorized below the plot, and the y-axis indicates the relative support for each model as Akaike weights (averaged across 100 posterior trees) and noted above each histogram as a percent of the total. Left column, top to bottom: agamid lizards, meliphagoid birds, pygopodoid geckos. Right column, top to bottom: sphenomorphine skinks, marsupial mammals.
   
   + _Figure S3._  
   Extinction does not change the preferred model of trait evolution in Australian vertebrates. On the left of the figure (left of the dotted line), a phylogenetic tree including both extinct and extant taxa, with elevated extinction in the Plio-Pleistocene, and the associated distribution of traits adjacent to it (red bars indicate extinct taxa). Below the tree is a lineage through time plot showing the influence of extinction, particularly in the Plio-Pleistocene, and denoted by a Tasmanian tiger Thylacine. Below this are results of comparative model fitting, with relative fit denoted by average AICc weights, and the model generating the data indicated in bold. Data was simulated under the novel Single-Rate Constraint model, as well as Brownian Motion (diffusion=0.1), Brownian Motion (diffusion=0.01), and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. On the right of the figure, the same methods after removal of all extinct taxa from the tree and data, resulting in the empirical (extant) tree and data only. In both extinct and extant model fitting, the generating model is always the preferred model, although false support for alternative models does increase slightly when only extant taxa are used. 
   
   + _Figure S4._  
   Extinction does not change the preferred model of trait evolution in Australian vertebrates. This figure accompanies the Materials and Methods section Simulating Extinction. Figure is organized by three regimes estimating alternative hypothetical extinction scenarios, separated by dashed lines: stochastic (time-homogeneous), elevated Plio-Pleistocene, elevated Miocene (mimicking late Miocene macroevolutionary slowdown). Within each scenario, the upper frame shows the phylogeny including extinct lineages, as well as a lineage through time plot to visualize the accumulation of diversity, and histograms of results of comparative model fitting of data simulated under (left to right): Brownian Motion (diffusion=0.1), Brownian Motion (diffusion=0.01), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Single Rate Constraint (SRC; BM+OU) processes (see Materials and Methods for specifics on simulation parameters). In the gray panel below are the tree, lineage through time plot, and model fitting results after removing extinct taxa from the tree and data. In both extinct and extant model fitting, the generating model is always the preferred model. In extant only trees/data, false support for alternative models does increase slightly, but not appreciably.

   Five biome classification of Australia based on a Köppen-Geiger system, and modified according to Stern, Harvey, Ernst (2000). 
   
   + _Figure S6._  
   Novel mode-variable models (single-rate constrained—SRC; two-rate constrained—TRC) can be accurately recovered using simulated data. 100 data sets were simulated under both SRC and TRC models (see SI Materials and Methods— Simulation Tests), then comparatively fit against mode-constant and mode-variable models. Average AIC weights for the generating model were ~60%.  
   
   + _Figure S7._  
   The constraint parameter alpha α can be reliably estimated from phylogenies of varied sizes by the Two Rate Constrained (TRC) model. Regression of estimated to simulated (true) alpha values return slopes of 0.945–0.966, showing a strong correspondence between these values, and the ability to estimate them. Relationship between estimated and simulated values are strongest at small values of alpha, and become increasingly difficult to estimate at values >7.  
   
   + _Figure S8._  
   The timing of the shift (tshift) between BM and OU models can be reliably estimated from phylogenies of varied sizes by the Two Rate Constrained (TRC) model. Regression of estimated to simulated (true) alpha values return slopes of 0.912–0.969, showing a strong correspondence between these values, and the ability to estimate them. Shift accuracy drops at depths greater than 15 million years. The saturation of each point (pink to red) indicates multiple estimates at that value.  
   
   + _Figure S9._  
   The constraint parameter alpha α can be reliably estimated from phylogenies of varied sizes by the Single Rate Constrained (SRC) model. Regression of estimated to simulated (true) alpha values return slopes of 0.919–1.016, showing a strong correspondence between these values, and the ability to estimate them. Relationship between estimated and simulated values are strongest at small values of alpha, and become increasingly difficult to estimate at values >5.  
   
   + _Figure S10._  
   The timing of the shift (tshift) between BM and OU models can be reliably estimated from phylogenies of varied sizes by the Single Rate Constrained (SRC) model. Regression of estimated to simulated (true) alpha values return slopes of 0.925–0.969, showing a strong correspondence between these values, and the ability to estimate them. Shift accuracy drops at depths greater than 15 million years. The saturation of each point (pink to red) indicates multiple estimates at that value.
