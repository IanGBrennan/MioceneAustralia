   + _Figure 1._ Shifts in evolutionary mode (BM to OU) of body size evolution are temporally clustered in the Late Miocene, and congruent with a shift in dispersal histories. (A) Dotted lines indicate the crown divergence of each focal radiation, and colors match the distribution of inferred shift timing. Shifts between rates or modes (or both) of trait evolution are tightly constrained to the Late Miocene (11â€“5 Million years ago). Colored line shows global trend in temperature through the Cenozoic, data from Cramer, Miller, Barrett and Wright (4). (B) Inferred trends in the dispersal history of Australian radiations from the Early Miocene to present. The observed trend in proportion of allopatric dispersal events (in green), exceeds the expected simulated proportion (purple), in the Late Miocene, coinciding with constraints on body size evolution of select Australian vertebrate clades. Note, scales of temperature and time differ between (A) and (B). MMCO, Mid Miocene Climatic Optimum.
